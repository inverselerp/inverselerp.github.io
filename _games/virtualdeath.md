Virtual Death is my first fully-featured game after my transition to the Unreal Engine.
It features [data assets], an inventory and inspection system, as well as puzzle solving.

There was a lot of new challenges to overcome as my first game of this size.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery to go along with this case study." %}

you can play it [here]
