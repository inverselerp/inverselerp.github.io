**Hi ðŸ‘‹**  
I'm Philippe, a **Technical Artist** passionate about solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of real-time visuals.

My Unreal Engine journey began over a decade ago with **UDK**, and along the way, I explored **Unity** and **Godot** to broaden my perspective on different game development paradigms.

After completing a Technical Artist internship at Unity Technologies and earning my **Masterâ€™s Degree in Game Programming & Management**, I transitioned into the industry, combining my Computer Science background with my artistic eye to bring **seemingly impossible visuals to life.**

Much of my career has been dedicated to **Fortnite: Battle Royale** and its ecosystem, where I've built an **extensive** array of **technical skills** in VFX, scripting, and real-time rendering while contributing to many different kind of games along talented people.
